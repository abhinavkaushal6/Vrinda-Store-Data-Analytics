Vrinda-Store-Data-Analytics
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Vrinda Store's performance for the year 2022, presented through an interactive dashboard built using Microsoft Excel. The goal is to help understand key sales trends and support data-driven decision-making.

The dashboard offers a visual and interactive summary of Vrinda Store's yearly performance, allowing users to filter and analyze data by month, product category, and sales channel. It includes a monthly trend analysis of orders versus total sales amount, gender-wise sales comparison, and a detailed breakdown of return, refund, and cancellation rates. Additionally, it highlights state-wise sales performance by showcasing the top five states, analyzes order distribution across different age groups and genders, and presents a channel-wise breakdown illustrating the contribution of each online platform such as Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, and others.

Before creating the dashboard, the data underwent thorough pre-processing to ensure accuracy and generate meaningful insights. The data gathering phase involved collecting all sales and order records for the year 2022 from Vrinda Store's systems. This was followed by data cleaning, which included removing duplicate records, handling missing or null values, and correcting inconsistencies such as standardizing product and state names. Further, the data was transformed by creating calculated columns for total sales amounts and order counts, and generating summary tables to enable smooth and efficient dashboard filtering.

The dashboard itself was entirely developed using Microsoft Excel, which served as both the data analysis and visualization tool. To explore the dashboard, users simply need to download or clone this repository and open the Excel file named Vrinda_Store_Annual_Report.xlsx. They can then use the interactive slicers to filter data by month, category, and channel, and analyze various charts and metrics to gain detailed insights into Vrinda Storeâ€™s performance.

Looking ahead, potential improvements include adding year-over-year comparisons to track growth trends more effectively, incorporating profitability and customer lifetime value metrics, and possibly migrating the dashboard to advanced visualization tools like Power BI or Tableau to enhance interactivity and analytical capabilities.
